# Student-Enrollment-System
## Normalization Write-Up
  To get from Unnormalized to First Normal Form, I ensured that tables possesed only relevant information and there was not any repeated information in columns.
  To make sure that I was in at least Second Normal Form, I certified that each non-key column was dependent on the primary key and all the information was specific to that primary key.
  Finally, I made sure that no non-key attribute was dependent on another non-key attribute. Thus ensuring that my database structure was Third Normal Form.

  4. Execute the Script
