# Student-Enrollment-System

## Added Django Rest Framework

## API url: /api/students

## Currently, only the Student model is exposed via the API

## 
* That DRF has been added.
        * The base URL for the API (e.g., `/api/`).
        * Which models are exposed via the API.
        * Basic instructions on how to test the API using the Browsable API (mentioning the need to log in first, e.g., `$ python manage.py runserver`, log in via web UI, then access `/api/`).
        * (Optional) URLs for Swagger/Redoc documentation if `drf-spectacular` was added.
        * Add an example commit: `$ git add . && git commit -m 'feat: Add DRF API endpoints' && git push`

* How to use the filtering/searching/ordering query parameters (provide examples like `?field=value`, `?search=term`, `?ordering=-field`).
        * How pagination works (e.g., default page size, query parameters like `?page=`).
        * The custom permission logic implemented (e.g., "Only owners can edit/delete").
        * Instructions for testing the new features, especially permissions.
